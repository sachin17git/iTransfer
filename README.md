# iTransfer-Neural-Style-Transfer
#### iTransfer is a model based on neural style transfer to transfer arbitrary style onto arbitrary images.
#### This trained model allows you to take an image and reproduce it with a new artistic style.
#### Here I have used 19 layers VGG Network like the one used in this paper https://arxiv.org/abs/1508.06576
